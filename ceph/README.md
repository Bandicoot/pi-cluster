# Ceph Storage Cluster Setup

This directory contains a playbook that configures Ceph storage on a Pi cluster. I initially set this up as part of my [6-node DeskPi Super6c video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT5UbSJOyog).

### Cluster configuration

Run the playbook:

```
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

TODO.

### Upgrading the cluster

Run the upgrade playbook:

```
ansible-playbook upgrade.yml
```

### Monitoring the cluster

TODO.
